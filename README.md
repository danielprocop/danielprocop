# Hi, I’m Daniel 👋

🚀 I'm building real-world AI solutions — starting with intelligent agents that make life easier and work more efficient.

🧠 I’m currently focused on:
- Learning and experimenting with LangChain, LLMs, memory and tool-based agents
- Developing **Quotix** – an AI assistant that helps generate smart home service quotes from text, images and context
- Laying the foundation for a future AI-focused company

🎯 My focus is on building **practical, human-centered AI tools**.  
I believe in applied intelligence, minimal design, and solving real problems with creativity and code.  
Along the way, I share what I learn — to grow, connect, and inspire.

📚 This space documents my journey.  
It’s where I build, test, and explore ideas — the first building blocks of something much bigger.
